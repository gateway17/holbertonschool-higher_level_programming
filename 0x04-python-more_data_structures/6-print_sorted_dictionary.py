# Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

#    Prototype: def print_sorted_dictionary(a_dictionary):
#    You can assume that all keys are strings
#    Keys should be sorted by alphabetic order
#    Only sort keys of the first level
# (donâ€™t sort keys of a dictionary inside the main dictionary)
#    Dictionary values can have any type
#    You are not allowed to import any module
